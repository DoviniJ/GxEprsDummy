\title{summary_permuted_binary function
This function uses plink2 and outputs the p value of permuted model in the target dataset, using pre-generated GWAS and GWEIS summary statistics files named B_trd.sum, B_add.sum and B_gxe.sum}
\usage{

  input_score3 = "B_gxe.sscore"
)
}
\arguments{

\item{Bcov_target}{Covariate file containing family ID, individual ID, standardized covariate, square of standardized covariate, and/or confounders of the target dataset as columns, without heading}

\item{n_confounders}{Number of confounding variables in the target dataset}
}
\value{
This function will output
\item{B_permuted_p.txt} the p value of the permuted model
}
