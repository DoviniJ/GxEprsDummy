\title{GWEIS_binary function
This function performs GWEIS using plink2 and outputs the GWEIS summary statistics files with additive SNP effects named B_add.sum and interaction SNP effects named B_gxe.sum}
\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{plink_path}{Path to the PLINK executable application}

\item{b_file}{Prefix of the binary files, where all .fam, .bed and .bim files have a common prefix}

\item{Bphe_discovery}{Phenotype file containing family ID, individual ID and phenotype of the discovery dataset as columns, without heading}

\item{Bcov_discovery}{Covariate file containing family ID, individual ID, standardized covariate, square of standardized covariate, and/or confounders of the discovery dataset as columns, without heading}

\item{thread}{Number of threads used}

\item{summary_output1}{Name of the additive SNP effects of the GWEIS summary statistics file specified by the user}

\item{summary_output2}{Name of the interaction SNP effects of the GWEIS summary statistics file specified by the user}
